# ChatGPT4Me

ChatGPT4Me is a program that enhances and customizes ChatGPT's underlying pre-trained LLM w/ transformer architecture. 

Prior to the launch of ChatGPT, OpenAI introduced InstructGPT -- a series of fine-tune models to follow instructions using a combo of supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) on base GPT-3 language models. 

Using available open-source code from other GPTs and OpenAI itself, as well as any publicly accessible APIs, ChatGPT4Me will use similar machine learning methodologies as InstructGPT to tailor ChatGPT to your liking.
